# Foodhub Delivery and Order Management System

FoodHub Company is a well-known fast food company locate in United State of America. 
It was started 14 years ago & the company management decided to open branches 
worldwide. So they are going to open a new branch in Sri Lanka as well. The company 
decided to hire a local database expert to develop a Database Management system to assist 
in this project for decision making. Therefore, the data should maintain accuracy & the 
consistency throughout the data life cycle. 

FoodHub Company only delivering foods for the customers & they are not offer or selling 
food in the outlets. For delivery they have separate staff, who are known as Riders. There 
are other type of employees as well, but their details are not recorded in the database in 
the initial level. In the initial level the company consider to keep records of food deliveries 
& related information only. If the system success, they will enhanced for Human Resource 
Management & Finance Management integrate with initial system of Delivery 
Management system.  

In this system the Customer will identify with unique Customer ID, Customer Name, NIC, 
Date of Birth, Contact Number & Address with Location No., Lane, Street & city. The 
customers’ address will consider as the order delivery address. One customer can place 
many orders. But one order will have only one customer. The order can be place over the 
phone & it will enter by a staff member of the company. Orders will identify by unique 
Order No, Order Date, Order Time, Order Status, Payment method that customer going to 
pay & order amount according to the order items. One order can have many items & one 
food item can be available in many orders. Items can be identify by Item Number, item 
name, Item Category & Price. Company facilitate the customers to know what the 
ingredients of the particular food item are. For that food items will contain ingredients as 
well, every food of the company will make with minimally with three ingredients. If the 
customer needs to know the ingredients of a particular food item, they can request while 
placing the order. The staff member who takes the order will able to provide the ingredients 
when it available in the system. When the order is dispatch from the outlet, the dispatched 
time should record in the database.  

In FoodHub company all food orders will be deliver by Riders who are identify by Employee 
number, Employee name with First Name, Middle Name & Last Name, NIC, Date of Birth, 
Contact Number, License number, Address & Age in the system. The company keeps 
records about the dependents of the employees as well. But in the initial level of the project 
they are willing to keep only the dependents records of the riders.  Dependents will be 
identify by the dependent name, the relationship to the rider & Date of Birth. But they don’t 
have their own unique field, so the company expect a solution for this problem as well. So 
as the database administrator you have to provide the most appropriate solution according 
to the theories & techniques of the relational database.  

Each rider will deliver the food items for the customers by using the company motor bikes 
& they are not assign to a specific rider. When they attend to work according to their shift 
the available motor bike will be assign to the rider for that shift. The motor bikes will be 
identify by unique vehicle registration number, brand, model, engine number, vehicle 
registered date & the colours of the particular motorbike. None of the motor bike is 
coloured with a single colour, the company use different themes to colour the bikes. 

According to the database theories you have to provide the facility to identify the records 
of that which bike is used by which rider on a specific date. Also need to keep records of 
the motor bike meter readings when it assigned to the rider & when it return by the rider. 
In the System development level the company doesn’t need the report generated part 
initially, it will include in the next level of the development. But the Database designs & 
system designs should include the reporting processes.
